# Team status - sanitized shared snapshot

Updated: 2026-11-07. Read `PROJECT_FILE_MAP.md` and inspect actual local files.
This is a team-readable snapshot of local `STATUS.md`, not another evidence ledger.
A clone intentionally lacks originals, real calls, signed access and local status.

## Ready for shared development

- Confirmed requirements and scoring specification are shared, including the
  November 7 user-relayed official clarifications and unresolved decisions.
- Three team-safe organizer PDF copies are shared. Visible pages are preserved;
  embedded links/actions and source metadata are removed. The signed DEV GET
  button is intentionally inactive. Original PDFs remain local and unchanged.
- `data/shared/DEV_synthetic_60.json` provides 60 unique synthetic text chats:
  RU=30, KZ=15, EN=15. IDs/content are unchanged. All five real voice records,
  their transcripts/audio links and related metadata are excluded.
- The full 65-record JSON remains authoritative and local-only. Its composition
  is RU=35/KZ=15/EN=15, including five real RU calls. Obtain it separately through
  an approved integration-owner handoff if a task needs voice/full DEV access.
- `CLAUDE.md` requires local filesystem discovery, including ignored files,
  before declaring materials missing. The tracked file map is maintained when
  important paths or sharing status change.
- Utility scripts inspect Git state and reproduce/check the shared subset.
  No dependencies were installed and no application was implemented.

## Required next work, not yet executed

- Confirm owners, runtime/model choice and the next authorized development scope.
  Build genuine evaluation of unseen inputs, configurable chat/call checklists,
  evidence-linked results and an appeal/reviewer workflow once authorized.
- A 20-case human-reviewed DEV benchmark is proposed: 12 calibration, 8 internal
  holdout. No IDs selected, human labels assigned or model predictions generated.
  Full voice coverage needs separate local-call access. Future labels must say
  `team_human`; official per-conversation development Ground Truth is unavailable.
- Top-50 selection prioritizes scoring accuracy on 10 unseen API transcripts.
  Exact accuracy metric, numerical selection weights, control API group/access
  and some policy/rounding/voice edge cases remain unspecified. See requirements.
- No application, external LLM evaluation, deployment or public repository has
  been created. Nothing here is a claim of measured scoring accuracy.

## Synchronization and publication

Use live Git preflight/fetch and history comparison, not this snapshot, to verify
current synchronization. Maintain one authoritative `main` and deliberate review.
The existing repository stays PRIVATE for development. The required eventual
public submission is a separately reviewed sanitized repository; do not expose
this private repository or copy its history publicly. Private sharing approval
does not authorize restricted materials or public redistribution.
